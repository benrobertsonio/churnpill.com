Ben Robertson is a serial entrepreneur and retention expert who has spent the last decade helping SaaS companies build sustainable growth engines. After experiencing firsthand the devastating impact of high churn rates at his previous startup, Ben became obsessed with understanding the patterns that predict customer loss.

His data-driven approach to retention has been featured in leading publications and he's a frequent speaker at SaaS conferences around the world. When he's not diving into cohort analyses, you can find Ben hiking in Marin County or experimenting with new coffee brewing methods.
