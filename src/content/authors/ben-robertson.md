Ben Robertson is a serial entrepreneur and retention expert who has spent the last decade helping SaaS companies build sustainable growth engines. After experiencing firsthand the devastating impact of high churn rates at his previous startup, Ben became obsessed with understanding the patterns that predict customer loss.
